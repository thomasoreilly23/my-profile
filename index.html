				<h1>Hello, I am Thomas !  </h1>
					<img src="Images/Profile.jpeg" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Thomas">
				<p>
					 My name is Thomas, I'm 18 years old and I'm from Paris. I have been living in Lille for 1 years to do my Cursus at IESEG School of Management. I am passionate about travelling, skiing and playing the guitar !

				<h2>Hobbies </h2>
					<p> As I said before, traveling is hobby of mine, although I don't get to do it as often as I'd like. I've been fortunate enough to travel to several continents and experience different cultures and landscapes. It's an activity that feeds and inspires me, and I hope to do more of it in the future. </p>

				<h2> Passions </h2>
					<p> Playing guitar has been a passion of mine for over a decade now. I started with an acoustic guitar, but now I mostly play electric. My father was a guitarist, which is how I got into it, but I've since made it my own passion. It's a way for me to express myself creatively and unwind after a long day. Skiing has been my favorite sport for as long as I can remember. I've been skiing at the same resort, Val d'Isère, since I was four years old, and I spent six years competing with the Racing Club. Although I refused to become a certified ski instructor, skiing has always been a way for me to escape and take risks. It's the thrill of taking risks that excites me the most.  </p>

				<h2> Projects </h2>
				<p>I've always dreamed of starting my own business and being independent, thanks to my family's entrepreneurial culture. However, I don't want to follow the current trend of young entrepreneurs creating successful companies in a matter of months. Instead, I'd like to start with working in business consulting or finance. Personally, I'd also like to travel the world and potentially make a life for myself abroad. </p>
